# Document Class Identification using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project aims to identify the class or category of a given document using machine learning techniques. Document classification is a fundamental task in natural language processing (NLP) and has various applications such as spam filtering, sentiment analysis, and topic categorization.

The project is implemented in Python, utilizing popular libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and numpy.

## Dataset
Describe the dataset used for training and testing the model. Include information such as:

- Source of the dataset
- Number of documents
- Classes/categories
- Any preprocessing applied to the dataset (e.g., tokenization, stemming, etc.)

## Features
Outline the features used for training the machine learning model. This may include:

- Word frequency
- TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)
- Word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, etc.)
- Other relevant features extracted from the text

## Model Selection
Describe the machine learning models experimented with for document classification. This could include:

- Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Random Forest
- Neural Networks (e.g., LSTM, CNN)
- Any ensemble methods used

## Evaluation Metrics
Explain the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the models. Common metrics for document classification include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, you may discuss any domain-specific evaluation criteria if applicable.

## Results
Present the results obtained from training and testing the models. Include:

- Performance metrics for each model
- Comparative analysis of different models
- Any insights gained from the results

## Usage
Provide instructions on how to use the code in this repository. Include steps such as:

1. Installation instructions
2. Required dependencies
3. How to train the model
4. How to use the trained model for prediction/classification

## Files Structure
Explain the structure of the project repository, highlighting important files and directories.
